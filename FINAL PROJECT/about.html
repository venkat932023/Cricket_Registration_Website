    <p>SELECTION CRITERIA
        The following factors will be considered by the selection committee when selecting the National Team;
        
         
        
        FORM
        
        Form is a critical factor. Players performance from 2021/22 CCA competitions will be taken into consideration and not just a single performance. Quality of opposition will also be taken into account. Non-Cyprus based players are required to provide evidence through league records.
        
         
        
        ABILITY
        
        A playerâ€™s ability is the most important factor in determining his selection. No one benefits from a player who is simply not able to contribute.
        
         
        
        TRAINING
        
        All players are encouraged to attend scheduled training sessions. If players are unable to attend training, it is their responsibility to advise the team manager of their situation and attend when possible. It is expected that players will attend at least 50% of the scheduled training sessions. It is expected that all players will approach training sessions in the same way that they would approach a game. Players are expected to work hard during training and support each other at all times.
        
         
        
        FITNESS
        
        Players are required to demonstrate satisfactory levels of fitness in a wide range of areas. To be a successful cricket player, it is advantageous to have good levels of speed, power, and endurance fitness, and also have good reflexes, flexibility, coordination, and low body-fat levels.
        
         
        
        TEAM BALANCE
        
        Selectors / Team Management are entitled to have team balance, both in relation to the spread of batsmen and bowlers in the team as well as the type of batsmen and bowlers.
        
         
        
        AVAILABILITY
        
        Every player will be considered available for selection unless they have notified accordingly.
        
         
        
        COMPLAINTS & GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
        
        The selection committee exists to help and provide support and will always be available to listen should players have any complaints, suggestions or constructive criticism regarding the selection process. All issues of this nature should initially be addressed to the Chairman of Selectors.</p>
